# Number-Systems-Converter
Firstly, when program first executes asks you to enter the number system which you want to convert your number. If you want binary system you should enter '2', if octal you should enter '8' and if hexa-decimal you should enter '16'. Then, you should enter your number's integer and floating part separately. For example, if you want to enter 67.43 as your number you should enter 67 for integer part and 0.43 as floating part. The program converts decimal system to any system you want. Moreover, it calculates the error rate.
